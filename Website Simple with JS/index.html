			<h3 class="title">Enter a World of Pure Imagination!</h3>
				<p>Have you ever wanted to create your own story but don't have time to put in the hours for Dungeons and Dragons?
				Or the skill for writing it yourself? Well, we're here to help you with that! All you need to do is fill out a 
				quick form and our writers would love to co-create a world with you. We feature the work of many student authors 
				and you are helping them as much as they are helping you to find a world of entertainment.</p>
				
				<p>We have some sample stories for your entertainment. Some of these are retellings of traditional stories with a 
				twist. Some poems are also featured for those of you that are poetheads.... Like me! My colleagues work tirelessly
				to provide the best amateur literature of our time. So dive in and explore our site, read some of our lit Lit 
				and get started building your own stories and poems.</p>
