			<h4 class="partListing">Pt. 1</h4>
			
			<p>Leelee stumbled through the grass that grew alongside the train tracks. Occasionally her head would start 
			pounding and she had to grab hold of it to keep it from blowing apart. Her mind seemed to be traveling 
			farther and farther away, too far for her to find it.<br>
			Leelee continued on her journey, going further into the glowing orange sunset. Where she was going, 
			she didn’t know. Honestly, she didn’t really care. Anywhere was better than the room she’d been trapped 
			in for so long. A stuffy room. White. So soft. Leelee groaned as the pain in her head caused her to fall 
			down on one knee on the sharp rocks covering the earth.<br>
			At least she was finally escaping. Leelee forced herself to get up, to keep going. The thought of those
			suited monsters, those fake smiles, drove her onward on her mission. Her mission to leave this demented city. 
			The grass itched her bare legs. Leelee scratched at it absentmindedly, taking no notice of the blood trickling down. 
			Her dirty white clothes hung about her, tattered and torn. Her escape hadn’t left her unscathed.</p>
			
			<h4 class="partListing">Pt. 2</h4>
			
			<p>They were bound to realize she was gone sooner or later. Leelee needed to be gone before then, or… they’d
			take her again. Sharp pains jabbed at Leelee’s brain, Leelee closed her eyes. Her mind was out of sight, she 
			could hardly see it anymore. The colors of the sky dripped down, blending into one big mess. Leelee shook her 
			head, clearing it. She looked around her, a wide expanse of barren wasteland filled with nothing but dry grass 
			and a pair of forgotten train tracks leading nowhere. All abandoned. Like she had been. Abandoned in that 
			prison of torture. Leelee cried out, tears spilling from her crazed eyes. Don’t think about it! She told herself. 
			Just run. Run away from it all.<br>
			Suddenly Leelee spun around, were they here? Or were they over there? She looked around her wildly, sure that 
			they were following her. Waiting in the tall grass to capture her again. They could be anywhere! Leelee ran forward, 
			stumbling as her heavy legs tripped her up. She panted in fear and desperation. She wouldn’t let them catch her, 
			she couldn’t! For miles and miles, Leelee ran, sure that they were right behind her, almost upon her. At last, 
			she fell to the ground, body trembling with exhaustion, mind pounding with terror.</p>
			
			<h4 class="partListing">Pt. 3</h4>
			
			<p>Leelee clutched her stomach as she felt the beginning of a bellyache.
			The sky was darkening, orange fading into a deep purple. Leelee lay there for some time. Laying as still and 
			quiet as she could, listening for any sounds close by. Nothing. Leelee stood up slowly, making sure not to let
			anyone see her. Then, she was off again. Running by the train tracks. Grass whooshing past, the sight of it out
			of the corner of Leelee’s eyes blurring through her tired tears. When would she make it out of this forsaken 
			place? Would she ever be free?<br>
			Leelee stood stock still, panic gaining control of her body. What if this was all a trap? Yes, that must be it!
			It was all a trap to make her give in to their demands! She could never make it out. Now Leelee knew that. 
			She laughed. It wasn’t a good laugh. Of course. Of course they would do this. Her laughter turned to angry 
			tears as she collapsed to the ground on her knees. Why? Why? Leelee clawed the rocky ground with her hands, 
			sobs wracking her body, hands bleeding...</p>
			
			<h4 class="partListing">Pt. 4</h4>
			
			<p>She would die here. Alone. Not even her mind to accompany her. She screamed into the night. Over and over,
			her unearthly cry of pain pierced the night air. Finally, throat hoarse, eyes empty of tears, Leelee’s body 
			hit the ground with a thud, unconsciousness finally catching up with her worn out body.<br>
			Two days later, police arrived at the train tracks, searching for an escaped insane asylum patient and found the 
			dead body of a young woman. Her name was Leelee.</p>
